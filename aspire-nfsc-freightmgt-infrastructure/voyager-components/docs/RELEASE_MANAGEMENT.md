## Release Management

Voyager has been built in a way to allow a rapid release cycle; however, major releases are set on a 4-weekly cycle.
These releases will be tagged using an incremental BREAKING.MAJOR.PATCH convention, e.g. V1.1.0 & V1.2.0  are releases of a new set of features while V1.0.1 & V1.0.2 are hotfixes to the code in release V1.0.0.

As development features become available there is also the ability to use pre-release tags. These new tags can be squad specfic to enable you to use
features you develop prior to general release but we ask that they follow the pattern of jiraticket-number_description e.g VGR-101_Adding_Request_For_Proper_Branching. Please see below example:
